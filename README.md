The command to make it works is: west build -b esp32s3_devkitc/esp32s3/procpu -p always -- -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=boards/esp32s3_devkitc.overlay.
Which -b is for the specific board, -p is pristine which make new build; (it may not efficient when you just need change some minor in .c files; so ommit it in those cases); the -- mean done the west parts; -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE is flag for CMake. Other cases, you amy choose some specific .conf like secrets.prj; using -DC0NF_FILE="prj;secrets.conf;tls.conf".
And for the error in this project is that i keep forget to include my board: my .overlay file; so this keep yelling me at the DEVICE_DT_GET. And yeah; the driver for dht.c is confusing too; you should look at the dht_init() first; it configure to gpio_pin_configure_dt(&cfg->dio_gpio, GPIO_OUTPUT_INACTIVE); so it seem kind of backward; like true is LOW; and false is HIGH; but yeah; it save our some while loop; it runs; it efficient; so we will leave it as is. But i will try to write my own driver version; which may not as efficient; but if it works then i will will learn a lot. And yeah; there are 2 ports for esp32s3; if you not seeing any log; switch to other port.
